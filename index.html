            <!-- ABOUT ME -->
        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I graduated with an Associates from <a target="_blank" href="http://normandale.edu">Normandale Community College</a>. I've worked many different customer orientated retail work throughout my career. One thing I enjoy the most is working with people! Whether it's working with my friends or meeting new people.</p> 
          <p>After years of working in customer service, I was drawn to software development as I had interacted and spoke with many developers who were in the field. I realized with the options to help create and develop applications would be a rewarding career for myself and helpful to others.</p>

          <p>As a student for <a target="_blank" href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> I will begin a journey as a software developer and couldn't be more excited!</p>
          <p>If you are looking for a new developer-in-training feel free to contact me! I am excited to meet other developers and eager to learn more.</p>
